    <h4>More Machine Learning: Neural Networks</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">
      11th April - 6:30pm - <a href="https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Showroom+Cafe+Bar/@53.3775542,-1.4652453,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3c3131fc81080ff5!8m2!3d53.3775542!4d-1.4652453">Showroom Cafe Bar</a> - <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/def-shef-34-more-machine-learning-neural-networks-tickets-33172491816">Tickets</a>
    </p>
    <p>In (def shef 34) we explored the k-nearest-neighbour classifier. This time, we're looking at a more well-known approach - neural networks.</p>
    <p>This is a bigger, more maths-y topic and it'll be a less structured exploration. We'll be officially exploring the theory and implementation by working through Andrej Kaparthy's <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/">Hacker's guide to Neural Networks</a> in languages of our choice, but you're also free to come along and take your own path!</p>

    <h4>Dojo: Machine Learning with kNN</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">
      7th March - 6:30pm - <a href="https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Showroom+Workstation/@53.3771232,-1.4675653,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487978659957b795:0xfc0f717d35a50d86!8m2!3d53.37712!4d-1.4653766?hl=en">Showroom Workstation</a> - <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/def-shef-33-tickets-31779533440">Get a Free Ticket</a>
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqYde-LULfs" target="_blank">k-nearest neighbours classifier</a> is a classic machine learning algorithm. We'll use functional languages to implement a classifier, then use it with real-world public data sets to solve classification problems.</p>
    <p>Once you've implemented and explored the algorithm, there are many details you can dive deeper on. How does your algorithm perform on larger data sets, and can you speed it up? How about plugging in different distance functions? If you're already an ML expert, you can look at a more advanced algorithm and compare performance with the kNN implementations.</p>
    <p>The plan is to run the dojo in small groups by language. I've
    put together a
    guide <a href="https://github.com/defshef/dojo-knn">here</a>, so
    feel free to get familiar with the problem ahead of time. I know
    at least one person plans to solve the problem in their go-to
    language before the dojo, then try to implement it in a different
      language in the session.</p>
    <p>If it goes well and there's interest, we could run a follow-up in a future (def shef) to review and dig more into the machine learning and optimisation aspects.</p>
    <p>We're trying free ticketing through EventBrite. You won't <strong>need</strong> a ticket to attend, but hopefully it'll help predict how many people are coming. We can also e-mail attendees any information they'll need, reminders, etc. Contact through this mechanism will be kept to a respectful minimum!
    </p>
    <p>If you have any feedback on the use of ticketing, positive or negative, please let us know on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/def-shef/w_2K7ZSuVds">Google Group</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/def_shef">@def_shef on Twitter</a> or by <a href="mailto:paul.brabban+defshef@gmail.com">email</a>.

    <p>
    After a brief hiatus, (def shef) is back for 2017 with a coding dojo.
    </p>
    <p>
    We'll be picking a small toy problem, and then breaking off into small groups to have a go at solutions in whatever functional programming language our hearts desire. If there's time we'll compare our solutions to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    This could be a great excuse to try something new, or simply to tinker with your pet language. Make sure you bring a laptop.
    </p>
    <p>
    The kata we'll be doing this month is <big><a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas/tree/master/alphabet-cipher">The Alphabet Cipher</a></big>. If you can read Clojure there are some <a href="https://github.com/gigasquid/wonderland-clojure-katas/blob/master/alphabet-cipher/test/alphabet_cipher/coder_test.clj">sample testcases</a> you can use. Any even remotely functional language or approach is allowed.

    <p>
      To kick things off we'll be doing some introductions, and then launching into a round-table discussion on "What's good about functional programming". We may even talk about some bad things too!
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll also be dicussing future plans for the group, so if you've got any great ideas - bring them along.

      This month we'll be running a practical session, solving some sample
      problems using lists, recursion and traditional functional approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problems will be suitable for newcomers to functional programming,
      but we'll also have some slightly trickier problems for those of you with
      a bit more experience.

    <h4>Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">13th May - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    You can never have too much Haskell, so this month we have
    <a href="https://twitter.com/codingteddybear">Andrei Pambuccian</a> talking
    to us about parallelism and concurrency.
    </p>
    <p>
Haskell features certain approaches to paralellism and concurrency that are specific to functional programming languages, enabling the programmer to quickly switch between sequential and parallel code. The presentation will explore parallel programming via the built-in monad Eval, the Strategy type and the monad Par, each of whom has its own trade-offs in terms of performance, maintainability and ease of implementation, then go into threading via Concurrent Haskell and finally describe the Haskell bindings for OpenCL. Sample code and performance statistics will be available for each of the methods described.

    <h4>An introduction to the Rust programming language</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">10th June - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    Something a bit different this month, we have
    <a href="https://twitter.com/davbo">Dave King</a> talking to us about
    something not entirely functional programming, but interesting and relevant
    regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
Mozilla Research are building an experimental web browser named
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/servo">Servo</a>.
While experienced with large C and C++ codebases they have avoided these languages for Servo.
Instead developing it in <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
a relatively new language also from Mozilla Research.
</p><p>
Rust is a systems level language with a focus on being a "safe, concurrent, practical language". Many features of Rust are drawn from the functional programming world such as algebraic data types and type inference.
</p><p>
Other features include:
</p><ul>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>closures</li>
<li>zero-cost abstractions</li>
<li>guaranteed memory safety</li>
<li>optional garbage collection</li>
<li>concurrency without data races</li>
<li>minimal runtime</li>
<li>efficient C bindings</li>

    <h4>Scala gives you <code>Option[S]</code></h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">8th July - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    This month <a href="https://twitter.com/i_c_murray">Ian Murray</a> is going
    to be giving a brief introduction to Scala, including it's approach to
    mixing OO- and FP-like language features.  Scala <em>encourages</em>, but
    does not <em>enforce</em>, use of several aspects from functional
    programming.  By being able to express different styles of programming,
    Scala is able to offer developers new to FP a more gradual learning curve,
    while still offering the <em>purer</em> functional programmer plenty to
    chew on.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a strongly- and
    statically-typed functional programming language that runs on the JVM, but
    also provides object-like features to try and provide the user with the
    best of both worlds.

    There's no official speaker this month, instead we'll be making the most of
    the British summer by hanging out in a beer garden. There'll still be plenty
    of functional chatter, and we'll be back with a proper talk in September.

    This month <a href="https://twitter.com/awsmsrc">Luke Roberts</a> will be
    telling us all about Go's channels, and the benefits that they bring.
    </p>
    <p>
    Channels are an abstraction around asynchronous message passing that can
    make code that deals with concurrency much easier to reason about.

    <p>
    <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strangeloop</a> is an awesome
    conference that features, among many other topics, lots of great practical
    and theoretical talks about Functional Programming. It was held on the 18th
    and 19th of September, and lucky for us they're publishing the recordings of
    every single talk already!

    <p>
      This month <a href="https://twitter.com/glenathan">I'll</a> be doing a bit
      of a practical session.
      <a href="http://clojure.org/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> is a variant of
      Clojure that runs compiles down to javascript and runs in the browser.
      Being a lisp that promotes immutable datastructures, it enables some
      really powerful approaches to building clean and simple user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be making use of some fancy live-reloading tools and judicious
      separation of state and behaviour in order to build up a functional user
      interface. For simplicity we'll be implementing <a
      href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md">TodoMVC</a>.
      Don't worry if you're not really a frontend person,
      we'll make sure there's plenty of sample code so you can focus on the
      important bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assist with setup and save time on the night, please ensure you have
      Java JRE 7 or 8 installed, as well as <a

      <li>Not quite right.</li>
      <li>Go back to step 1, do not pass go, do not collect £200.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Interpreted languages, fast compile times &amp; fast test suites are great
      at reducing the feedback cycle, but those aren't the only areas where
      feedback is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if you could edit your code and see the effects immediately?
      Going from step 1 to step 7 in the scenario above without having to do
      anything in between. How would having that sort of instant feedback affect
      the way you work?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll show how this can be achieved in a few different common (and
      uncommon) programming languages, and what sort of concessions (if any) you
      have to make in your code to make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't just a crazy fringe idea: it's been around in some form or
      another for ages, and it's something we can and should be using right now.

    <h4>An introduction to F# by way of turtles</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">
      9th June - 6:30pm - <a href="http://www.union-st.org/">Union St</a>
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a> is a statically-typed, open source, functional-first language on the CLR which combines
      functional idioms such as immutability and
   pattern matching with advanced features like type providers and asynchronous workflows, while remaining accessible to the
   less functionally-inclined by including a healthy dose of OO and everything that comes with the .net ecosystem.</p>

      <p>
          In this session, <a href="https://twitter.com/relentlessdev">Grant Crofton</a> will be showing everyone how awesome it
      is by using it to write a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a> interpreter,
      commonly used to draw stuff with Turtles.  This may or may not include any live coding, depending on how much he wants the audience to suffer..</p>

    <h4>The ClojureScript Experience</h4>

    </p>
    <p>
      We haven't had a practical session for a while, and as there was quite a small turnout to <a href="#defshef12">(def shef 12)</a>, I've decided to re-use the exercise from that one again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be working on a small TodoMVC implementation written using Reagent and ClojureScript. No previous knowledge is required, but it will help if you have <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation">Leiningen</a> installed before you arrive.

      This month we'll be hearing from
      <a href="https://twitter.com/allegary">Gary Martin</a>:
    </p>
    <p>
      When we look to start a new programming project, we often take the tools we
      already know for granted and reach for the tools that we know. This is as true
      for databases as it is for programming languages. In this talk we are going to
      look at using a graph database as an appropriate storage model for Markov chains
      and conversation simulation.

    <h4>PureScript and functional programming on the web.</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">
      13th October - 6:30pm - <a href="http://www.union-st.org/">Union St</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Becky Conning will be getting us excited about PureScript and functional programming on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
    Becky has used Javascript for everything for quite a while and over time has found the approaches and technologies that were helping her the most have their roots in functional programming. Today she works for SlamData writing web application tests and features using PureScript every day.
    </p>
    <p>
    Purescript is written in and inspired by Haskell. Luckily for us web developers, Purescript modules compile to CommonJS modules making  it surprisingly easy to interface between Javascript and Purescript in both directions.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are also versions of Purescript in development that compile to Python and C++.
    </p>
    <p>
    Becky will be sharing her excitement about the possibilities of functional programming for application development with you and we’ll building a small application to help get you motivated.
    </p>
    <p>So whether you’re a Javascript developer, a seasoned functional programmer or just interested in applications come on down and get excited about Purescript and functional programming for applications!

    <h4>From techno to textiles: live coding pattern in Haskell</h4>

    <p>
    This month <a href="http://slab.org">Alex McLean</a> will be talking to us
    about music, in his own words:
    </p>
    <p>
    I've been writing code to make music since around the year 2000, at first in
    Perl but more recently in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, in
    particular developing the free/open source <a
    href="http://tidal.lurk.org/">Tidal</a> environment since around 2010. Tidal
    represents musical pattern as pure functions from time to events, providing
    an expressive language for sequencing, combining and transforming patterns.
    I've performed widely with Tidal in a range of collaborations, including as
    part of the Algorave movement that I co-founded.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk I'll demonstrate Tidal, go through the way that pattern is
    represented and try to unearth how pure functional programming has made it
    possible. I'll try to make it interesting for people new to programming and
    functional programming, as well as the more experienced. If there's time and
    interest I can also talk about related research I'm involved with in
    representing the structure of textiles in a similar manner.

      12th April - 6:30pm - <a href="http://www.union-st.org/">Union St</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    This month we'll be working on something practical you can sink your teeth into and get a flavour of somewhat-real-world functional programming.
    </p>
    <p>
    The plan is to take a task that we'd normally think of as something that fits object oriented programming very well, and see how to approach it with our functional hats on.
    </p>
    <p>
    The format will be small groups split by choice of language, so hopefully there should be something to interest everyone. I can guarantee some Clojure, for anything else it'll depend who shows up. Bring your laptops!

    <p>This month we've got Ben Robinson giving us a talk:</p>
    <p>
    Traditionally when creating UI apps we end up having maintain lots of mutating (and fragile) state. So we will creating a simple desktop application from the ground up using using a Functional Reactive Programming style (and judiciously borrowing ideas ideas from modern frameworks like React/Flux) that is declarative and easy to understand.
