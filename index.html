    <h2>(def shef 1)</h2>
    <p class="meeting-info">12th November - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
      To kick things off we'll be doing some introductions, and then launching into a round-table discussion on "What's good about functional programming". We may even talk about some bad things too!
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll also be dicussing future plans for the group, so if you've got any great ideas - bring them along.

    <h2>(def shef 2)</h2>
    <p class="meeting-info">10th December - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
      This month we'll be running a practical session, solving some sample
      problems using lists, recursion and traditional functional approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problems will be suitable for newcomers to functional programming,
      but we'll also have some slightly trickier problems for those of you with
      a bit more experience.
    </p>
    <p><a href="/meeting-2.html">The problems are available here</a></p>

      This month we'll be looking through some of the solutions to last month's
      problems, and planning out some sessions for the months ahead.

    <h4>Parallelism and Concurrency in Haskell</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">13th May - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    You can never have too much Haskell, so this month we have
    <a href="https://twitter.com/codingteddybear">Andrei Pambuccian</a> talking
    to us about parallelism and concurrency.
    </p>
    <p>
Haskell features certain approaches to paralellism and concurrency that are specific to functional programming languages, enabling the programmer to quickly switch between sequential and parallel code. The presentation will explore parallel programming via the built-in monad Eval, the Strategy type and the monad Par, each of whom has its own trade-offs in terms of performance, maintainability and ease of implementation, then go into threading via Concurrent Haskell and finally describe the Haskell bindings for OpenCL. Sample code and performance statistics will be available for each of the methods described.

    <h4>An introduction to the Rust programming language</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">10th June - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    Something a bit different this month, we have
    <a href="https://twitter.com/davbo">Dave King</a> talking to us about
    something not entirely functional programming, but interesting and relevant
    regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
Mozilla Research are building an experimental web browser named
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/servo">Servo</a>.
While experienced with large C and C++ codebases they have avoided these languages for Servo.
Instead developing it in <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
a relatively new language also from Mozilla Research.
</p><p>
Rust is a systems level language with a focus on being a "safe, concurrent, practical language". Many features of Rust are drawn from the functional programming world such as algebraic data types and type inference.
</p><p>
Other features include:
</p><ul>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>closures</li>
<li>zero-cost abstractions</li>
<li>guaranteed memory safety</li>
<li>optional garbage collection</li>
<li>concurrency without data races</li>
<li>minimal runtime</li>
<li>efficient C bindings</li>

    <h4>Scala gives you <code>Option[S]</code></h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">8th July - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    This month <a href="https://twitter.com/i_c_murray">Ian Murray</a> is going
    to be giving a brief introduction to Scala, including it's approach to
    mixing OO- and FP-like language features.  Scala <em>encourages</em>, but
    does not <em>enforce</em>, use of several aspects from functional
    programming.  By being able to express different styles of programming,
    Scala is able to offer developers new to FP a more gradual learning curve,
    while still offering the <em>purer</em> functional programmer plenty to
    chew on.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a strongly- and
    statically-typed functional programming language that runs on the JVM, but
    also provides object-like features to try and provide the user with the
    best of both worlds.

    <h4>A Summer Social</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">12th August - 6:30pm - Rutland Arms</p>
    <p>
    There's no official speaker this month, instead we'll be making the most of
    the British summer by hanging out in a beer garden. There'll still be plenty
    of functional chatter, and we'll be back with a proper talk in September.

    <h4>Channels in Go</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">9th September - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    This month <a href="https://twitter.com/awsmsrc">Luke Roberts</a> will be
    telling us all about Go's channels, and the benefits that they bring.
    </p>
    <p>
    Channels are an abstraction around asynchronous message passing that can
    make code that deals with concurrency much easier to reason about.

    <h4>Strange Loop Movie Night</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">14th October - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strangeloop</a> is an awesome
    conference that features, among many other topics, lots of great practical
    and theoretical talks about Functional Programming. It was held on the 18th
    and 19th of September, and lucky for us they're publishing the recordings of
    every single talk already!
    </p>
    <p>
    We ended up watching and dsicussing the following two talks:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwrCQmpZ8Ts"
        >Coder Decoder: Functional Programmer Lingo Explained, with Pictures</a> by Katie Miller</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i7KrG1Afbk"
        >Idris: Practical Dependent Types with Practical Examples</a> by Brian McKenna</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Straightforward UIs with ClojureScript</h4>
    <p class="meeting-info">11th November - 6:30pm - Electric Works</p>
    <p>Entry to the Electric Works will be around the back after 5:30pm, head up
    the stairs by the car park entrance and follow the building around to your
    right.</p>
    <p>
      This month <a href="https://twitter.com/glenathan">I'll</a> be doing a bit
      of a practical session.
      <a href="http://clojure.org/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> is a variant of
      Clojure that runs compiles down to javascript and runs in the browser.
      Being a lisp that promotes immutable datastructures, it enables some
      really powerful approaches to building clean and simple user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be making use of some fancy live-reloading tools and judicious
      separation of state and behaviour in order to build up a functional user
      interface. For simplicity we'll be implementing <a
      href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md">TodoMVC</a>.
      Don't worry if you're not really a frontend person,
      we'll make sure there's plenty of sample code so you can focus on the
      important bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assist with setup and save time on the night, please ensure you have
      Java JRE 7 or 8 installed, as well as <a
      href="http://leiningen.org/#install">leiningen</a>.

    <p>
      This month, in a continuation of our unofficial "Neat things in language

      to us about some of the more interesting features of
      <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The example code shown is going to be in
      <a href="http://www.call-cc.org/">Chicken Scheme</a>, so feel free to
      brush up a little bit beforehand.

    <p>Note that this month we have a new larger venue! We'll gather in the
    lobby from about 6:15 before heading upstairs once people arrive.</p>
    <p>
      After the success of the last movie night, we return with another:
      Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure is well known for his very well laid out
      and generally excellent technical talks.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be selecting from the handily prepared <a
      href="http://thechangelog.com/rich-hickeys-greatest-hits/">Rich Hickey's
      Greatest Hits</a>. Be prepared to hear about how we can simplify what
      we're doing to build software, and how to spend more time thinking. There
      might be some mention of Functional Programming and Lisps in there too.
